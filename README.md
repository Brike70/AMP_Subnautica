# BrikeNet Subnautica AMP Server Profile

## Intro

Based off the legacy template from the offical repo, this should
hopefully allow people to run the newer Nitrox version.

## Setup

Add this repo:

`Brike70/AMP_Subnautica`

to your repo sources in:

`Configuration -->
Instance Deployment -->
Instance Management -->
Configuration Repositories`

## Notes

There's a couple of bits with the config that need fixing for it to
tie in properly with AMP. You'll want to just edit the config file directly
once it's started for the first time.

Best of luck.
